Flexible Mobility Services Testbed
===============

**MobilityTestbed** is an interaction-rich simulation model designed to test and **evaluate** various **DARP algorithms** (Dial-A-Ride Problem) or other, central or decentralized, coordination or resource-allocation mechanisms within on-demand transportation systems.

It allows users to:
* easily plug in *their own algorithms*, 
* run them in different realistic *benchmark scenarios*, 
* *visualize* the runs,
* discover the *weaknesses and strengths* of their algorithms
* and *compare* their *performance* with the alternatives.
